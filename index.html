                        balls of dough.These are then cooked in a mixture of hot water and rose 
                        water, then cooked again in milk until it reduces to form a rich reduction

                       in the northern state of Punjab or in the western state of Rajasthan. A creamy
                       concoction that lies somewhere between a cake and a soft fudge,  it is made by 
                       reducing cardamom flavored milk and sugar for hours until it solidifies into a
                       crumbly, firm cake, which is then topped with crunchy pistachios.</b>   </pre>
